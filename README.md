# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [Spotify top 50 songs in the US from 2010 to 2019](https://gist.github.com/bbbbrianna/e74082354cbdfe18d42c7b66ecdefa76)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line chart, and it shows the change of the signatures of the 10 most popular songs from 2010.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How do people's taste of music changes since 2010?
 * Is there a trend of music evaluated by their factors?(e.g. bpm, dance)
 * Which artist became more popular and which became less popular?
 * Is there any interactions of the music features?

## Sketches
The following are my sketches of how the project will look like.
* the composition of top genres overtime
* the dynamic visualization of the most popular singers from 2010
* the line chart shows the trend of popular music features

## Open Questions

I am not sure how to make the animation of the most popular 10 artist over time.
