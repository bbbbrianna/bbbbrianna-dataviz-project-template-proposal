# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [top 50 songs in the US from 2010 to 2019](https://gist.github.com/bbbbrianna/e74082354cbdfe18d42c7b66ecdefa76). This dataset includes the most popular songs played in the US in 2010-2019, which was originally from Spotify, each attribute's meaning can be retrieved from [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/).

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line chart, and it shows the change of the signatures of the 10 most popular songs from 2010.

The data was preprocessed to calculate [the means of features from the top 10 music every year](https://gist.github.com/bbbbrianna/7472f5bf8f2bbab14a3e4411cf8869e0).

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does people's taste of music change since 2010?
 * Is there a trend of music can be evaluated by their factors?(e.g. bpm, dance)
 * Which artists are becoming more or less popular?
 * Is there any interaction of the music features?

## Schedule of Deliverables

## Sketches
The following are my sketches of how the project will look like.
* the composition of top genres overtime

## Open Questions

I am not sure how to make the animation of the most popular 10 artist over time. There should be some website providing such template for the time-following bar chart
