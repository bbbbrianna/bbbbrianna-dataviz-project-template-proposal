# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [Spotify top 50 songs in the US from 2010 to 2019](https://gist.github.com/bbbbrianna/e74082354cbdfe18d42c7b66ecdefa76)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line chart, and it shows the change of the signatures of the 10 most popular songs from 2010.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How do people's taste of music changes since 2010?
 * Is there a trend of music evaluated by their factors?(e.g. bpm, dance)
 * Which artist became more popular and which became less popular?
 * Is there any interactions of the music features?

## Sketches


## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
